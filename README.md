# CounterApp

Hello Everyone,
This is a simple Counter App, made with HTML, JavaScript, basically a learning project.

here, user can increment, decrement the value on the clicks and also be able to reset the Counter.
For click events I have used addEventListener, Arrow Functions of JavaScript.
For body components HTML and styling done using Tailwind CSS.
